This React Project was created as a template for a single page profile app and a companion site to a 
tutorial I wrote on creating a React App from a bootstrap template.

Check out the walkthrough on my site: [coming soon]

I started with a bootstrap/Jquery template from https://wrapbootstrap.com 
and ported it to React. 

If you want to use this app, please preview what it looks like, and purchase a license 
for the template project here: https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/sphere-material-design-resume-cv-WB00FD040 

Any work that I did, separate from the template app, feel free to use any way you would like.  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To Run This App: 

* Download/Clone the app
* cd to the directory you cloned to 
* From terminal Run `npm install`
* From terminal Run `npm start`
* Navigate on your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
